Hello everyone! In this repositery, you can find a cone of the old DVD Screensaver. That screen which everyone liked to watch and get excited when it hits the corner. Using this is simple. Just download both .png and .py files and put them in the same folder. And then open the .py file. Then you will get those old vibes of DVD Screensaver. It will appear in fullscreen as usual and the DVD logo will bounce off the screen and change its color. You might think there is only one color that is white, but you are wrong. The script contains codes that changes the color of the logo. And when you want to exit, just press ESC key or press Alt+F4. If you liked this project, ⭐ it!
